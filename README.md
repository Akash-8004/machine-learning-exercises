# 🤖 Machine Learning Exercises  

This repository is my **practice log for Machine Learning**.  
It contains Jupyter notebooks organized by topics such as regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation, and more.  

Each folder represents a **specific ML concept or algorithm**, and will keep growing as I learn new techniques.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- Each folder = one ML topic (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)  
- Inside each folder = one or more Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with exercises, datasets, and visualizations  

---

## 🚀Topics  

✔ Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, cleaning)  
✔ Regression (Linear, Logistic, Multiple Regression)  
✔ Classification (Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forests)  
✔ Clustering (K-Means, etc.)  
✔ Model evaluation (Cross-validation, metrics)  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV)  
 Neural Networks & Deep Learning  
 Advanced ML algorithms

## 🛠️ How to Use  

Clone this repository and open in **Jupyter Lab / Notebook**:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akash-8004/machine-learning-exercises.git
cd machine-learning-exercises
jupyter lab
```
